    It's an RPG where you have to collect the tools to fix the system.  As you fix parts of the system, what happens???
    First thing you need to do is get the lights back on.
    You need the widget, the wodget and the sproket.
    Once it's back online, you win.

    It's in an office, with desks and furniture and whatnot.  The office was broken into and the theives freaked out 
    when the alarm went off so they started dropping pieces as they were running out.  So the pieces are not where we
    expect them to be, they are in some random places.

    There's a timer, we're losing money every second that the system is offline and the goal is to lose the least amount
    of money.
