    It's an RPG where you have to collect the tools to fix the system.  As you fix parts of the system, what happens???
    First thing you need to do is get the lights back on.
    You need the widget, the wodget and the sproket.
    Once it's back online, you win.

    It's in an office, with desks and furniture and whatnot.  The office was broken into and the theives freaked out 
    when the alarm went off so they started dropping pieces as they were running out.  So the pieces are not where we
    expect them to be, they are in some random places.

    There's a timer, we're losing money every second that the system is offline and the goal is to lose the least amount
    of money.

    it's basically an escape room game
    it's nighttime outside, the power is out, but there is a window by the entrance
    that includes some moonlight, enough to help you find a flashlight
    there are 10 levels, 
        some on the same floor, 
        some accessible by stairs
        intermediate levels are mostly smaller
        last level is notably larger? maybe
        consider randomizing the game levels for replayability
    items required to perform certain interactions
        key to open a door
        flashlight to find the correct disk in the drawer
    need to collect lots of data to complete the restore
